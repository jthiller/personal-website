In April 2013 I attended Photo Hack Day 4 with one thought in mind. &#8220;<em>I won second at PHD3. It might be a little crazy, but I know I can do better than that.</em>&#8220;

Going into the hackathon, I had no project ideas. One friend that I made at a previous hackathon would also be there, so we decided to team up. Together, we found a couple of other folks who'd fit in to build a solid team. We threw ideas around for a while, but couldn't decide on anything concrete. It wasn't until six hours into our 24 hour hackathon that we landed on the idea for a service to help people find great and inspiring images across the globe. At that point, it was time to get busy. With 18 hours to go, we quickly discussed the app structure. Then I dove into the design of the app while the others built out the backend framework.

On page load, the application geolocates based on the user's IP. This added detail helps to make the app feel more friendly and easier to understand. The users' thought process can begin with an already recognized place.

Once a trip has been entered, the app draws the shortest path between the two points and populates the view with top-rated pictures.
The user can customize their trip by changing their route to create detours for scenic spots.
