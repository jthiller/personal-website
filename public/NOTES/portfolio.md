## Redesign 2014
Whenever I approach a redesign of my portfolio, I like to turn it into a wishlist of things I'd like to learn or see. It has been over five years since I last did a redesign, and the web world had changed a lot since then.


When I approach a redesign of my own portfolio, I take it as an opportunity to learn as many new topics as possible as well as create something that feels ‘new’ to the internet. This time around, I took the opportunity to explore Node.js. I’ve had limited experience with Node on a second-hand basis in the past; both of the winning hackathon projects I worked on operated via a Node backend.
