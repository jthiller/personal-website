Shortly after starting at JOBY as an intern, I was presented with the opportunity to redesign their aging iPhone app, GorillaCam, from the ground-up.

The project presented many possibilities for improvement and experimentation. With a 'sky's the limit' mentality, I jumped right in. Fortunately I had been a user of the earlier versions of GorillaCam before working at JOBY. This familiarity made my understanding of the userbase and community easier.

With the app's features and guidelines outlined, I began wireframing the app. I was able to quickly test out the early wireframes within the team. Once the wireframes hit a certain point of completion, I tested them out on coworkers.
