## At Home with Design: Acme Made & San&nbsp;Francisco

> One of the most picturesque cities in the world, San Francisco is an area packed with inspiration. Founded in 2002, AcmeMade flourishes in this 7x7 square mile city of innovation and culture. Understanding the city, the distinct look of its people and the activities they enjoy, is how AcmeMade draws its product ideas. From photographing sunsets at the beach or reading on the pier, to working in the park or racing in a morning commute - inspiration is available at every turn.

> AcmeMade’s design center in San Francisco is where these inspirations turn into great products - each designed to protect your gear and complement your personality and style.

> Vibrant thoroughfares and neighborhoods such as Noe Valley, Fillmore Street, Montgomery Street, Oak Street, and Bay Street inspire the AcmeMade design group to create products that reflect a love of technology and style.

In approaching the AcmeMade redesign, I wanted to showcase the brand's style through the eyes of the target consumer as well as that of the designer. I had the benefit of sitting next to Luis Quehl (the brand’s primary designer) while I was an intern, so I had a decent familiarity with the brand’s core. Luis had the flexibility to build the brand around his vision of what a stylish tablet sleeve or camera backpack should look like; minimalist, clean, and simple. As this extension of Luis, AcmeMade saw that a camera bag wasn't solely about the gear but about fashion and the person wearing it.

I met with the brand managers and product designers to gather a sense of the intention of the brand. Andy, the primary brand manager, provided a powerpoint of '''****'''. Luis, the lead designer, provided a mood board consisting of beautiful homes that represented his vision of the customer. We had conversations about the products, how they had been represented the past, and how lacking the existing e-commerce site was at telling the product's design story.

### Let's make something new.
With an idea of what the brand looked like, it was now time to formulate a structure for a completely redesigned website.
In e-commerce, there are many existing conventions that a user has come to expect when doing some online shipping. Add too much pollution to this process, and the shopping experience is impaired.

The first logical step in designing the site was to develop some sort of hierarchy for the brands products, both present and future.

* Define product sets
* Recognize content demands for products
* Support CMS automation

Coding on the [Magento](magento.com) e-commerce platform was a unique learning curve. A fresh install of Magento has over 24,000 separate template, logic, and routing files; all working together to generate an extremely complex and capable website.
